# To Do

- [ ] Implement projectiles, at least one projectile attack (pistol), and impact functionality.
- [ ] Make a particle system.
- [x] Add a "scan-line" screen effect.
- [x] Change world units to 1 unit = 1 tile.
- [x] Add a camera and rotation system so that we always head "up".
- [x] Remove the mass-dependent push-away of actors. When an actor tries to move into another actor, it should simply push itself away.
- [x] Currently, diagonal movement against walls has no effect on the other, unblocked axis. We need to do this.
